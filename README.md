## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to use the basics of flexblox property and was able to understand the use of min-width and max-width of media query. I also had a glimpse of the use of float and I will be using it for future challenges.

### Continued development

Somehow, I feel like I was able to code the challenge easily this time since my first challenge. I was able to explore and understand other css properties that was able to help me complete this challenge.

### Useful resources

- [Google Fonts](https://www.fonts.google.com) - Still using this website to get my fonts, it is easy and contains a lot of fonts.
- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - I still rely on this website since it provides simplified explanations with examples.
